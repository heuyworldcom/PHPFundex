PHPFundex walks a folder structure, reads all .php files (read only), and extracts the Type, Parameters, Line number of every function(). 
It creates SQL statements to insert the data into a MySQL database. The SQL to create the database is also provided.

I use this all the time. Have fun with it and making custom changes to it.

It is written VS 2013 C#
